                CHAPTER II<br></br>
                The She-Wolf
            </h3>
            <p>Breakfast eaten and the slim camp-outfit lashed to the sled, the men turned their backs on the cheery fire and launched out into the darkness. At once began to rise the cries that were fiercely sad—cries that called through the darkness and cold to one another and answered back. Conversation ceased. Daylight came at nine o’clock. At midday the sky to the south warmed to rose-colour, and marked where the bulge of the earth intervened between the meridian sun and the northern world. But the rose-colour swiftly faded. The grey light of day that remained lasted until three o’clock, when it, too, faded, and the pall of the Arctic night descended upon the lone and silent land.</p>
            <p>As darkness came on, the hunting-cries to right and left and rear drew closer—so close that more than once they sent surges of fear through the toiling dogs, throwing them into short-lived panics.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of one such panic, when he and Henry had got the dogs back in the traces, Bill said:</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I wisht they’d strike game somewheres, an’ go away an’ leave us alone.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“They do get on the nerves horrible,”</span> Henry sympathised.</p>
            <p>They spoke no more until camp was made.</p>
            <p>Henry was bending over and adding ice to the babbling pot of beans when he was startled by the sound of a blow, an exclamation from Bill, and a sharp snarling cry of pain from among the dogs. He straightened up in time to see a dim form disappearing across the snow into the shelter of the dark. Then he saw Bill, standing amid the dogs, half triumphant, half crestfallen, in one hand a stout club, in the other the tail and part of the body of a sun-cured salmon.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“It got half of it,”</span> he announced; <span class="dialogue">“but I got a whack at it jes’ the same. D’ye hear it squeal?”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“What’d it look like?”</span> Henry asked.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Couldn’t see. But it had four legs an’ a mouth an’ hair an’ looked like any dog.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Must be a tame wolf, I reckon.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s damned tame, whatever it is, comin’ in here at feedin’ time an’ gettin’ its whack of fish.”</span></p>
            <p>That night, when supper was finished and they sat on the oblong box and pulled at their pipes, the circle of gleaming eyes drew in even closer than before.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I wisht they’d spring up a bunch of moose or something, an’ go away an’ leave us alone,”</span> Bill said.</p>
            <p>Henry grunted with an intonation that was not all sympathy, and for a quarter of an hour they sat on in silence, Henry staring at the fire, and Bill at the circle of eyes that burned in the darkness just beyond the firelight.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I wisht we was pullin’ into McGurry right now,”</span> he began again.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Shut up your wishin’ and your croakin’,”</span> Henry burst out angrily. <span class="dialogue">“Your stomach’s sour. That’s what’s ailin’ you. Swallow a spoonful of sody, an’ you’ll sweeten up wonderful an’ be more pleasant company.”</span></p>
            <p>In the morning Henry was aroused by fervid blasphemy that proceeded from the mouth of Bill. Henry propped himself up on an elbow and looked to see his comrade standing among the dogs beside the replenished fire, his arms raised in objurgation, his face distorted with passion.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Hello!”</span> Henry called. <span class="dialogue">“What’s up now?”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Frog’s gone,”</span> came the answer.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“No.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I tell you yes.”</span></p>
            <p>Henry leaped out of the blankets and to the dogs. He counted them with care, and then joined his partner in cursing the power of the Wild that had robbed them of another dog.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Frog was the strongest dog of the bunch,”</span> Bill pronounced finally.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“An’ he was no fool dog neither,”</span> Henry added.</p>
            <p>And so was recorded the second epitaph in two days.</p>
            <p>A gloomy breakfast was eaten, and the four remaining dogs were harnessed to the sled. The day was a repetition of the days that had gone before. The men toiled without speech across the face of the frozen world. The silence was unbroken save by the cries of their pursuers, that, unseen, hung upon their rear. With the coming of night in the mid-afternoon, the cries sounded closer as the pursuers drew in according to their custom; and the dogs grew excited and frightened, and were guilty of panics that tangled the traces and further depressed the two men.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“There, that’ll fix you fool critters,”</span> Bill said with satisfaction that night, standing erect at completion of his task.</p>
            <p>Henry left the cooking to come and see. Not only had his partner tied the dogs up, but he had tied them, after the Indian fashion, with sticks. About the neck of each dog he had fastened a leather thong. To this, and so close to the neck that the dog could not get his teeth to it, he had tied a stout stick four or five feet in length. The other end of the stick, in turn, was made fast to a stake in the ground by means of a leather thong. The dog was unable to gnaw through the leather at his own end of the stick. The stick prevented him from getting at the leather that fastened the other end.</p>
            <p>Henry nodded his head approvingly.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s the only contraption that’ll ever hold One Ear,”</span> he said. <span class="dialogue">“He can gnaw through leather as clean as a knife an’ jes’ about half as quick. They all’ll be here in the mornin’ hunkydory.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You jes’ bet they will,”</span> Bill affirmed. <span class="dialogue">“If one of em’ turns up missin’, I’ll go without my coffee.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“They jes’ know we ain’t loaded to kill,”</span> Henry remarked at bed-time, indicating the gleaming circle that hemmed them in. <span class="dialogue">“If we could put a couple of shots into ’em, they’d be more respectful. They come closer every night. Get the firelight out of your eyes an’ look hard—there! Did you see that one?”</span></p>
            <p>For some time the two men amused themselves with watching the movement of vague forms on the edge of the firelight. By looking closely and steadily at where a pair of eyes burned in the darkness, the form of the animal would slowly take shape. They could even see these forms move at times.</p>
            <p>A sound among the dogs attracted the men’s attention. One Ear was uttering quick, eager whines, lunging at the length of his stick toward the darkness, and desisting now and again in order to make frantic attacks on the stick with his teeth.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Look at that, Bill,”</span> Henry whispered.</p>
            <p>Full into the firelight, with a stealthy, sidelong movement, glided a doglike animal. It moved with commingled mistrust and daring, cautiously observing the men, its attention fixed on the dogs. One Ear strained the full length of the stick toward the intruder and whined with eagerness.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“That fool One Ear don’t seem scairt much,”</span> Bill said in a low tone.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s a she-wolf,”</span> Henry whispered back, <span class="dialogue">“an’ that accounts for Fatty an’ Frog. She’s the decoy for the pack. She draws out the dog an’ then all the rest pitches in an’ eats ’m up.”</span></p>
            <p>The fire crackled. A log fell apart with a loud spluttering noise. At the sound of it the strange animal leaped back into the darkness.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Henry, I’m a-thinkin’,”</span> Bill announced.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Thinkin’ what?”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I’m a-thinkin’ that was the one I lambasted with the club.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Ain’t the slightest doubt in the world,”</span> was Henry’s response.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“An’ right here I want to remark,”</span> Bill went on, <span class="dialogue">“that that animal’s familyarity with campfires is suspicious an’ immoral.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“It knows for certain more’n a self-respectin’ wolf ought to know,”</span> Henry agreed. <span class="dialogue">“A wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at feedin’ time has had experiences.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Ol’ Villan had a dog once that run away with the wolves,”</span> Bill cogitates aloud. <span class="dialogue">“I ought to know. I shot it out of the pack in a moose pasture over ‘on Little Stick. An’ Ol’ Villan cried like a baby. Hadn’t seen it for three years, he said. Ben with the wolves all that time.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I reckon you’ve called the turn, Bill. That wolf’s a dog, an’ it’s eaten fish many’s the time from the hand of man.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“An if I get a chance at it, that wolf that’s a dog’ll be jes’ meat,”</span> Bill declared. <span class="dialogue">“We can’t afford to lose no more animals.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“But you’ve only got three cartridges,”</span> Henry objected.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I’ll wait for a dead sure shot,”</span> was the reply.</p>
            <p>In the morning Henry renewed the fire and cooked breakfast to the accompaniment of his partner’s snoring.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You was sleepin’ jes’ too comfortable for anything,”</span> Henry told him, as he routed him out for breakfast. <span class="dialogue">“I hadn’t the heart to rouse you.”</span></p>
            <p>Bill began to eat sleepily. He noticed that his cup was empty and started to reach for the pot. But the pot was beyond arm’s length and beside Henry.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Say, Henry,”</span> he chided gently, <span class="dialogue">“ain’t you forgot somethin’?”</span></p>
            <p>Henry looked about with great carefulness and shook his head. Bill held up the empty cup.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You don’t get no coffee,”</span> Henry announced.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Ain’t run out?”</span> Bill asked anxiously.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Nope.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Ain’t thinkin’ it’ll hurt my digestion?”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Nope.”</span></p>
            <p>A flush of angry blood pervaded Bill’s face.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Then it’s jes’ warm an’ anxious I am to be hearin’ you explain yourself,”</span> he said.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Spanker’s gone,”</span> Henry answered.</p>
            <p>Without haste, with the air of one resigned to misfortune Bill turned his head, and from where he sat counted the dogs.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“How’d it happen?”</span> he asked apathetically.</p>
            <p>Henry shrugged his shoulders. <span class="dialogue">“Don’t know. Unless One Ear gnawed ’m loose. He couldn’t a-done it himself, that’s sure.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“The darned cuss.”</span> Bill spoke gravely and slowly, with no hint of the anger that was raging within. <span class="dialogue">“Jes’ because he couldn’t chew himself loose, he chews Spanker loose.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Well, Spanker’s troubles is over anyway; I guess he’s digested by this time an’ cavortin’ over the landscape in the bellies of twenty different wolves,”</span> was Henry’s epitaph on this, the latest lost dog. <span class="dialogue">“Have some coffee, Bill.”</span></p>
            <p>But Bill shook his head.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Go on,”</span> Henry pleaded, elevating the pot.</p>
            <p>Bill shoved his cup aside. <span class="dialogue">“I’ll be ding-dong-danged if I do. I said I wouldn’t if ary dog turned up missin’, an’ I won’t.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s darn good coffee,”</span> Henry said enticingly.</p>
            <p>But Bill was stubborn, and he ate a dry breakfast washed down with mumbled curses at One Ear for the trick he had played.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I’ll tie ’em up out of reach of each other to-night,”</span> Bill said, as they took the trail.</p>
            <p>They had travelled little more than a hundred yards, when Henry, who was in front, bent down and picked up something with which his snowshoe had collided. It was dark, and he could not see it, but he recognised it by the touch. He flung it back, so that it struck the sled and bounced along until it fetched up on Bill’s snowshoes.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Mebbe you’ll need that in your business,”</span> Henry said.</p>
            <p>Bill uttered an exclamation. It was all that was left of Spanker—the stick with which he had been tied.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“They ate ’m hide an’ all,”</span> Bill announced. <span class="dialogue">“The stick’s as clean as a whistle. They’ve ate the leather offen both ends. They’re damn hungry, Henry, an’ they’ll have you an’ me guessin’ before this trip’s over.”</span></p>
            <p>Henry laughed defiantly. <span class="dialogue">“I ain’t been trailed this way by wolves before, but I’ve gone through a whole lot worse an’ kept my health. Takes more’n a handful of them pesky critters to do for yours truly, Bill, my son.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I don’t know, I don’t know,”</span> Bill muttered ominously.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Well, you’ll know all right when we pull into McGurry.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I ain’t feelin’ special enthusiastic,”</span> Bill persisted.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You’re off colour, that’s what’s the matter with you,”</span> Henry dogmatised. <span class="dialogue">“What you need is quinine, an’ I’m goin’ to dose you up stiff as soon as we make McGurry.”</span></p>
            <p>Bill grunted his disagreement with the diagnosis, and lapsed into silence. The day was like all the days. Light came at nine o’clock. At twelve o’clock the southern horizon was warmed by the unseen sun; and then began the cold grey of afternoon that would merge, three hours later, into night.</p>
            <p>It was just after the sun’s futile effort to appear, that Bill slipped the rifle from under the sled-lashings and said:</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You keep right on, Henry, I’m goin’ to see what I can see.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You’d better stick by the sled,”</span> his partner protested. <span class="dialogue">“You’ve only got three cartridges, an’ there’s no tellin’ what might happen.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Who’s croaking now?”</span> Bill demanded triumphantly.</p>
            <p>Henry made no reply, and plodded on alone, though often he cast anxious glances back into the grey solitude where his partner had disappeared. An hour later, taking advantage of the cut-offs around which the sled had to go, Bill arrived.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“They’re scattered an’ rangin’ along wide,”</span> he said: <span class="dialogue">“keeping up with us an’ lookin’ for game at the same time. You see, they’re sure of us, only they know they’ve got to wait to get us. In the meantime they’re willin’ to pick up anything eatable that comes handy.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You mean they <i>think</i> they’re sure of us,”</span> Henry objected pointedly.</p>
            <p>But Bill ignored him. <span class="dialogue">“I seen some of them. They’re pretty thin. They ain’t had a bite in weeks I reckon, outside of Fatty an’ Frog an’ Spanker; an’ there’s so many of ’em that that didn’t go far. They’re remarkable thin. Their ribs is like wash-boards, an’ their stomachs is right up against their backbones. They’re pretty desperate, I can tell you. They’ll be goin’ mad, yet, an’ then watch out.”</span></p>
            <p>A few minutes later, Henry, who was now travelling behind the sled, emitted a low, warning whistle. Bill turned and looked, then quietly stopped the dogs. To the rear, from around the last bend and plainly into view, on the very trail they had just covered, trotted a furry, slinking form. Its nose was to the trail, and it trotted with a peculiar, sliding, effortless gait. When they halted, it halted, throwing up its head and regarding them steadily with nostrils that twitched as it caught and studied the scent of them.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“It’s the she-wolf,”</span> Bill answered.</p>
            <p>The dogs had lain down in the snow, and he walked past them to join his partner in the sled. Together they watched the strange animal that had pursued them for days and that had already accomplished the destruction of half their dog-team.</p>
            <p>After a searching scrutiny, the animal trotted forward a few steps. This it repeated several times, till it was a short hundred yards away. It paused, head up, close by a clump of spruce trees, and with sight and scent studied the outfit of the watching men. It looked at them in a strangely wistful way, after the manner of a dog; but in its wistfulness there was none of the dog affection. It was a wistfulness bred of hunger, as cruel as its own fangs, as merciless as the frost itself.</p>
            <p>It was large for a wolf, its gaunt frame advertising the lines of an animal that was among the largest of its kind.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Stands pretty close to two feet an’ a half at the shoulders,”</span> Henry commented. <span class="dialogue">“An’ I’ll bet it ain’t far from five feet long.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Kind of strange colour for a wolf,”</span> was Bill’s criticism. <span class="dialogue">“I never seen a red wolf before. Looks almost cinnamon to me.”</span></p>
            <p>The animal was certainly not cinnamon-coloured. Its coat was the true wolf-coat. The dominant colour was grey, and yet there was to it a faint reddish hue—a hue that was baffling, that appeared and disappeared, that was more like an illusion of the vision, now grey, distinctly grey, and again giving hints and glints of a vague redness of colour not classifiable in terms of ordinary experience.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Looks for all the world like a big husky sled-dog,”</span> Bill said. <span class="dialogue">“I wouldn’t be s’prised to see it wag its tail.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Hello, you husky!”</span> he called. <span class="dialogue">“Come here, you whatever-your-name-is.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Ain’t a bit scairt of you,”</span> Henry laughed.</p>
            <p>Bill waved his hand at it threateningly and shouted loudly; but the animal betrayed no fear. The only change in it that they could notice was an accession of alertness. It still regarded them with the merciless wistfulness of hunger. They were meat, and it was hungry; and it would like to go in and eat them if it dared.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Look here, Henry,”</span> Bill said, unconsciously lowering his voice to a whisper because of what he imitated. <span class="dialogue">“We’ve got three cartridges. But it’s a dead shot. Couldn’t miss it. It’s got away with three of our dogs, an’ we oughter put a stop to it. What d’ye say?”</span></p>
            <p>Henry nodded his consent. Bill cautiously slipped the gun from under the sled-lashing. The gun was on the way to his shoulder, but it never got there. For in that instant the she-wolf leaped sidewise from the trail into the clump of spruce trees and disappeared.</p>
            <p>The two men looked at each other. Henry whistled long and comprehendingly.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I might have knowed it,”</span> Bill chided himself aloud as he replaced the gun. <span class="dialogue">“Of course a wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at feedin’ time, ’d know all about shooting-irons. I tell you right now, Henry, that critter’s the cause of all our trouble. We’d have six dogs at the present time, ’stead of three, if it wasn’t for her. An’ I tell you right now, Henry, I’m goin’ to get her. She’s too smart to be shot in the open. But I’m goin’ to lay for her. I’ll bushwhack her as sure as my name is Bill.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“You needn’t stray off too far in doin’ it,”</span> his partner admonished. <span class="dialogue">“If that pack ever starts to jump you, them three cartridges’d be wuth no more’n three whoops in hell. Them animals is damn hungry, an’ once they start in, they’ll sure get you, Bill.”</span></p>
            <p>They camped early that night. Three dogs could not drag the sled so fast nor for so long hours as could six, and they were showing unmistakable signs of playing out. And the men went early to bed, Bill first seeing to it that the dogs were tied out of gnawing-reach of one another.</p>
            <p>But the wolves were growing bolder, and the men were aroused more than once from their sleep. So near did the wolves approach, that the dogs became frantic with terror, and it was necessary to replenish the fire from time to time in order to keep the adventurous marauders at safer distance.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“I’ve hearn sailors talk of sharks followin’ a ship,”</span> Bill remarked, as he crawled back into the blankets after one such replenishing of the fire. <span class="dialogue">“Well, them wolves is land sharks. They know their business better’n we do, an’ they ain’t a-holdin’ our trail this way for their health. They’re goin’ to get us. They’re sure goin’ to get us, Henry.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“They’ve half got you a’ready, a-talkin’ like that,”</span> Henry retorted sharply. <span class="dialogue">“A man’s half licked when he says he is. An’ you’re half eaten from the way you’re goin’ on about it.”</span></p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“They’ve got away with better men than you an’ me,”</span> Bill answered.</p>
            <p><span class="dialogue">“Oh, shet up your croakin’. You make me all-fired tired.”</span></p>
            <p>Henry rolled over angrily on his side, but was surprised that Bill made no similar display of temper. This was not Bill’s way, for he was easily angered by sharp words. Henry thought long over it before he went to sleep, and as his eyelids fluttered down and he dozed off, the thought in his mind was: <span class="dialogue">“There’s no mistakin’ it, Bill’s almighty blue. I’ll have to cheer him up to-morrow.”</span></p>
