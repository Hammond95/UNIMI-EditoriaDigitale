Fontfamily Fabrik by Uwe Borchert 
E-Mail: uwe.borchert@gmx.de

This typeface is initialy based on Beteckna Ver. 0.2
by Johan Mattsson and inspired by the (original) Erbar 
Grotesk, Drescher Grotesk BT (Drescher Grotesk BT 
SmallSizes -> Footnote), house numbers, road signs 
in Germany, the numbers of Prof. Dr. Klein, Paul 
Renners Bahnhofsfutura (1924) and Bauhaus-movement. 
In short this is a real ,,Deutsche Grotesk'' (on
american english a "german gothic") in 1920th style.

Black     : real fat Headlines
Bold      : medium and small Headlines (*)
Regular   : textfont
Condensed : condensed Textfont
BoldCond  : condensed Headlines (since Version 1.1)
Italic    : quotes (not realy good)
Footnote  : very small Text (Footnotes, experimental)

(*) Use should use black or a real display typeface 
    for big headlines

There are three fontforge-script for generating the 
first guesses for the bold, condensed and italic out 
of the normal/regular font. See in the subdirectory
scripts for: sfd2bold.ff, sfd2cond.ff and sfd2ital.ff. 
There are also a few *.sh an *.ff scripts for the 
automatic batch conversion in the top directory.
    
The typeface "Fabrik" is made for labels on glasses 
with spice to replace the commercial typefaces Futura 
and/or Drescher Grotesk BT. The free typeface Tapir 
(inspired by Rudolf Kochs Kabel, aka Cable) is used 
for the headlines.

This fonts includes long-s and st-ligature for the
blackletter style typesetting of the german language.
For the proper usage of the long-s and st-ligature
consult the ,,Duden'', Chapter: ,,Maschinenschreiben,
Textsatz und E-Mails'' (Typewriting, Typesetting and
E-Mails).
